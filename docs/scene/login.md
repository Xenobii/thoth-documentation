Once inside a THOTH scene, you will be prompted to **log in**. Logging in will unlock THOTH's editing functionalities: 

* Toolbox
* Layer management
* Model management
* Collaborative sessions
* Exporting

The recommended default admin user provided by ATON has the following credentials:

Username| `ra`
:---|:---
**Password**| `ra2020`

*Note that you can still view models without logging in in ****view only mode****, without being able to alter any of the scene components.*
