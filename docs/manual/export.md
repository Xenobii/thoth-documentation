A user can save the changes applied to a scene by selecting the **export button** on the layer or model toolbar or by pressing the shortcut **Shift + E**. This will save the changes to the scene json located within the appropriate directory.

In order to save changes successfuly, you must be logged in as an authenticated administrative user. **For demo purposes**, the admin user defined by ATON has the following credentials:

Username| `ra`
:---|:---
**Password**| `ra2020`

*Note that exporting is an irreversible action.*
