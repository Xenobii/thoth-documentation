## Model overview

The models panel is the main control point for importing, deleting and managing models. On a technical level, this corresponds the **nodes** attached to the root scene.

## Adding models to the scene

You can add new models in the scene by selecting the **Add model button** in the models panel, or by pressing **Shift + A**.

Models are, by default retrieved from the local ATON directory and must follow the [specifications defined by ATON](https://osiris.itabc.cnr.it/aton/index.php/tutorials/creating-3d-content-for-aton/).

## Managing imported models

Once a model is properly imported to your scene, you can manage the following attributes.

* **Visibility**: You can toggle the visibility of a model using the **visibility icon** on the left of the model controller.

* **Transforms**: You can modify the position and rotation of a selected object with the respective controls on any 3D axis.

Additionally, you can **focus** on a specific model by using the **focus button** for a selected layer. You can also view the meshes attached to each model.

*The viewpoints functionalities are a work in progress.*

## Deleting models

The user can delete a model by pressing the **Delete button** on the models's controller. This action is reversable.
