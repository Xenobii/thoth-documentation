# Metadata

The scene layer, as well as any created layer in a scene, is paired with a set of metadata. This metadata is meant to describe the scene, along with any models inside it or the selections of each layer respectively.

You can edit the metadata of the scene layer or any other layer using the **edit metadata** buttons on the scene/layer controller from the **Layer Panel**. You can also open the metadata editor using the shortcuts **Shift + S** or **Shift + {layer id}** respectively.

## Schema selection

Any of this metadata is formed according to a selected metadata schema which the user can choose when filling the metadata for any layer. The schema must follow a set of specifications as to how it's structured. Default demo schemas ```annotation_schema.json``` and ```test_schema.json``` come with the default THOTH installation.

## Attributes

Once you have selected a valid schema, you can edit any of the attributes generated according to the schema. Once you have set the desired values, save the changes to the metadata by pressing the **save changes button**. 

## Inheritting from the scene layer

You can inherit the metadata schema and values assigned to the scene layers to any selected layer by pressing the respective **inherit metadata button** inside the metadata editor.
